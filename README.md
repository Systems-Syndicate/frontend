To begin run npm start in `chessboard/` or `phone/`

## Mobile App
To run the app on Expo Go you will need to run both the back-end API and the front-end React Native.

In the back-end code, in the api directory, run using poetry (following the Readme there).

In another terminal, in the phone directory, run the front-end React Native using `npx expo run`.

If there are issues, you may need to check the API URL being run in the back-end and check it corresponds to the one expected in the front-end.
